# How to Use Basic Commands in JS
### Starting to code using Javascript
- Background and fill

> The first and most basic command you will learn is the Background() command.
> Depending on what software you are using, if you just type background() it will usually autofill right away. 
> If the autofill works, then you will see a command that looks just like this.

**Background(255, 255, 255,)**

> These three parameters are numbers that represent how much blue, red and green are in the background. (you can change these parameters)
- Text

> Var is the next most important command you need to know how to be able to do. Var stands for varible and it is essentially used to store information.
> The first thing that you need to do to store data is type the command **var = (whatever you want to name your data)**.
>Then type the the name of your varible and whatever number you want it to equal. **(example: var = money; var money = 123)**
